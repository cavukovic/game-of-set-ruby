# Game of Set Ruby
This is a Ruby CLI game mimicking the game of set. This application creates two players and deals twelve unique cards. Players can choose that they have either found a set or don't think one exists. Finding a set gives a player one point and removes those three cards and deals three more. Choosing that the player thinks there is no set runs a check on the current cards to see if this is true or not and displays that information to the player. The game ends when a player decides they are done or when the game is out of cards.

To run the application, run "bundle exec ruby main.rb"
